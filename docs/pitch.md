# SkillGarden Pitch Script (3 minutes)

## Opening (30 sec)

"Raise your hand if you've ever been at a panel and couldn't decide between taking notes and actually being present."

"What if you didn't have to choose?"

"And what if everything you learned was verified, structured, and provably yours?"

## Problem (30 sec)

"Today's learning is broken in 3 ways:"

1. "Content is unreliable. Articles have errors. Speakers cite wrong stats. AI hallucinates."
2. "Consuming isn't learning. You read 50 articles and retain nothing."
3. "Credentials are meaningless. LinkedIn says you know something because you typed it."

## Solution (60 sec)

"SkillGarden fixes all three."

"Step 1: Capture anything. Article, panel, podcast, YouTube video. BizCrush handles noisy rooms. Claude extracts every discrete claim."

"Step 2: White Circle AI validates every claim before it enters your knowledge graph. Bad data never reaches your brain."

"Step 3: Structured skill trees with prerequisites. You can't study advanced topics without proving the foundations. Like RuneScape - you cut willows before yews."

"Step 4: Prove mastery. Not just multiple choice. Socratic voice debates with ElevenLabs. Steelman the opposing view. Teach it back. If you can't explain it, you don't own it."

"Step 5: Verifiable credentials on an exponential curve. Level 92 is halfway to 99 in terms of effort. A Level 99 means something. Put it on your resume. Employers can verify it."

## Demo (45 sec)

Live demo with one of the 5 skill trees.

## Close (15 sec)

"LinkedIn says you know it because you typed it. SkillGarden proves you know it because you defended it, debated it, taught it, and maintained it. Level 99 means something."
