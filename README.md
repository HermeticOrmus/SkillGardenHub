> **Learn What's True. Prove What You Know.**

An AI-powered learning platform that ingests content from any source, validates it for accuracy, builds structured skill trees, and certifies mastery through an exponential credentialing system inspired by RuneScape's leveling curve.

## The Problem

1. **You can't learn and experience at the same time** - panels, lectures, podcasts demand attention OR notes, not both
2. **Content is unreliable** - articles have errors, speakers cite wrong stats, AI hallucinates
3. **Consuming is not learning** - reading something doesn't mean you retained it
4. **Credentials are binary** - pass/fail doesn't capture depth of understanding
5. **No structure** - most platforms let you wander without prerequisites

## The Solution

**Capture** any content (articles, panels, podcasts, videos, textbooks, Claude chats)
**Validate** every claim through White Circle AI truth gate before it enters your knowledge
**Structure** learning into prerequisite-gated skill trees (can't cut yew before willow)
**Test** mastery through adaptive assessments at every Bloom's level
**Certify** with an exponential 0-99 credentialing system where Level 99 means something

## Sponsor Integration

| Sponsor | Role | Phase |
|---------|------|-------|
| **BizCrush** | Captures panels, lectures, conversations in noisy environments | Ingest |
| **Anthropic (Claude)** | Extracts claims, generates assessments, evaluates responses | Process + Test |
| **White Circle AI** | Truth Gate - validates sources, claims, AI fidelity | Validate |
| **Perle** | Human experts review uncertain claims, grade high-level assessments | Validate + Certify |
| **ElevenLabs** | Voice recaps, Socratic debate agent, teach-back evaluation | Deliver + Test |
| **Blaxel** | Persistent sandboxes - knowledge graph, skill trees, XP tracking | Store + Track |
| **Finny** | Content prospecting - recommends sources targeting knowledge gaps | Recommend |
| **Lovable** | Builds the full-stack app | Interface |

## Architecture

```
INGEST --> VALIDATE --> STRUCTURE --> TEST --> CERTIFY
```

## Key Concepts

### RuneScape XP Curve (Levels 0-99)
- Levels 1-92 require the same total XP as levels 92-99
- Early levels are fast and encouraging
- True mastery (90+) requires exponential effort
- Level 99 is a genuine, verifiable signal

### White Circle Truth Gate
- Every claim validated before entering the knowledge graph
- Source credibility, factual accuracy, AI fidelity checks
- Conflicts classified as ERROR vs LEGITIMATE DEBATE
- Nothing unverified reaches the learner

### Structured Skill Trees
- Prerequisites are gates, not suggestions
- XP isolation: content maps to correct skills only
- Style adapts (audio/visual/reading), structure doesn't
- Test-out option respects existing knowledge
